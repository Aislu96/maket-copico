Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, including but not limited to, lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general, are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight.
